The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter

Increment the sequence with 3:

for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)
 
 
use range() with a negative step  to create a range in reverse

for x in range(10, 0, -1):
  print(x)
